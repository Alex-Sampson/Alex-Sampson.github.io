### About Me:
My path through academia has been non-standard to say the least. I was born and raised in Missoula, MT where I completed my undergraduate degree in applied mathematics at the University of Montana (UM). While I left UM with a degree in applied mathematics, the vast majority of my time there was spent in the Physics Department. In my senior years at UM I began taking graduate courses in Applied Mathematical Methods and Dynamical Systems Theory. It was these course, and my deep interest in the mathematical formalisms that underpinned fascinating fields like Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity that lead me to decide to pursue my graduat degree in Applied Mathematics.

In 2021 I would become a part of University of Nevada, Las Vegas's (UNLV's) graduate program and would take courses ranging from Numerical Methods to Non-linear Analysis and Variational Calculus. While I enjoyed my coursework at UNLV I was unfortunately unable to find any research opportunities that aligned with my academic goals.

In 2025 I would make the move across the country to Tallahassee Florida to join Florida State University's (FSU's) Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics as a PhD Student. While I have not yet secured a formal research topic I hope to continue my tradition of exploring uniquely applied fields where the tools of Analysis, Algebra and Geometry can provide effective tools for deepining our understanding of these applied systems.

### Teaching:
Teaching has been one of the most impactful parts of my graduate career thus far. While I was able to get to where I am today through alot of hard work and stubbornness, I was not always a 'Math Person'. In highschool I failed or barely passed nearly all math courses, and because of this my undergraduate career saw significantly slow progression. Having struggled with math anxiety my whole life, I enjoy as an educator being able to help others in a similar situation overcome these struggles. As someone who overcame these difficulties I feel I have a somewhat unique insight into the challenges many of my students face and I feel it is my duty to help them through those.
