### About Me
   I grew up in Missoula, Montana, and completed a B.A. in Applied Mathematics (minor in Physics) at the University of Montana. Taking graduate courses in applied mathematical methods and dynamical systems in my senior years at UM solidified my desire to pursue a graduate degree. I entered the graduate program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 2021, where I completed advanced sequences in analysis and differential equations (nonlinear analysis, variational methods, numerical methods, complex analysis, ODEs, and PDEs). In 2025 I transferred to Florida State University to better align my long-term interests with available research opportunities.

   My **primary interests lie at the intersection of pure and applied mathematics**, using **analysis and geometry** to study applied topics such as **shape analysis**, **geometric PDEs on infinite-dimensional manifolds**, **optimal transport and Wasserstein geometry**, and **PDE models motivated by physics and biology**. I am particularly motivated by **analytical techniques**, including: functional analysis (Sobolev spaces and operator theory), variational methods (direct method and energy minimization), topological degree and fixed-point frameworks (e.g., Leray–Schauder), energy and a-priori estimate methods, maximum/comparison principles, spectral and semigroup methods for linearization and stability, and elliptic/parabolic regularity theory for qualitative properties of solutions.

**Current interests (not comprehensive):**
* **Shape analysis & geometric methods:**
  * infinite-dimensional Riemannian geometry of shape spaces; geometric PDEs on spaces of curves and surfaces  <br>
* **Optimal transport & Wasserstein geometry:**
   * Analytical and geometric perspectives for shapes, signals, and distributions  <br>
* **PDEs in applications:**
  * Modeling and analysis for problems arising in physics and biology; particualrly in regards to qualitative properties of solutions  <br>
* **Variational and topological methods:**
   * Weak solution frameworks, energy methods, and degree theory <br> 
* **Stability and bifurcation theory:** 
   * Qualitative dynamics in nonlinear systems supporting the themes above <br>

While I have not secured a specific research direction, work in any of these fields excites me.

### Teaching

Teaching has been one of the most meaningful parts of my graduate experience. I wasn’t always a “math person”, I struggled with math anxiety in high school and advanced slowly at first, so I’m especially committed to helping students build confidence. In my classes, I emphasize clear structure, multiple solution pathways, and low-stakes practice that de-stigmatizes mistakes. My goal is to make rigorous mathematics **approachable, honest, and useful**, meeting students where they are and helping them get where they want to go.
